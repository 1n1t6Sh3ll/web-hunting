Injection Point for SQL Injection
●SQL Injection can be GET Based
There attacker have to attack through urls parameter
example any.com/filename.programming?parameter=vale
-------------------------------------------------------------
●SQL Injection can be  POST Based 

Attackr have to find any html form that may execute sqli query 
eg:
signup from
login form 
contact form 
etc ..
-------------------------------------------------------------
●SQL Injection can be Header Based
You have to attack on hearder parameter
such as - Referrer | User-Agent | Location | Host 
--------------------------------------------------------------
●SQL Injection can be Cookie Based 

You have to find coopie parameter 
eg: Cookie: username=wihlfi;

Learn SQLi Query Fixing 

SQLI Get Based 
●Find Injection Point 
●Identify Vulnerability 
●Balance the Query 
●Try to Inject SQLI Statement there 

Double Query SQLI
●error/double based sqli query -> hackbar->error/double->get database 

Blind Boolien Based sqli
●Balance Query is necessary
●And 1=1 (True)
●OR 1=1 (True)
●And 1=2 (False)
●OR 1=2 (False)

Blind Time Based sqli 
●Balance Query is necessary 
●And SLEEP(10)  if sleep then Vulnerable 
●OR SLEEP(10) if sllep then vulnerable 

Exploitation of SQLI 

Post based SQLI
●Find Injection Point 
●Identify Vulnerability 
●Balance Query 
●Try to execute any SQLI Statement there 
●Inject Database Query 


Header Based SQLI
●You have to look for Headers Parameter to find Injection Point 
such as Host | User-Agent | Referrer | Location 


Cookie Based SQLI
●Find any Cookie parameter and try to execute any SQLi Statement

Waf Bypassing for SQLI
●Web application Firewall  Bypassing 
●WAF Filter Malicious illegal input 
●There are many techniques to bypass waf

Authentication Bypassing
●The error message includes the SQL query used by the login function. 
We can use this information to construct an injection attack to bypass authentication. 
The first account in a database is often an administrative user, 
we can exploit this behavior to log in as the first user in the database.


Automation of SQLI GET Based
●RequirementInstall Python 2.7  on your Environment 
●Download SQLMAP Zip file from sqlmap.zip 
●Command for GET Based SQLI Basic Command python sqlmap.py -u “URL” --batch –banner
●Advance Command python sqlmap.py -u “URL” --level=5 --risk=3 --keep-alive --fresh-queries --random-agent --batch --banner  


Automation of SQLI POST Based | Header Based | Cookie Based
●RequirementInstall Python 2.7  on your Environment 
●Download SQLMAP Zip file from sqlmap.zip 
●Command for POST Based SQLI Basic Command python sqlmap.py -r requestfile.txt --batch –banner
●Advance Command python sqlmap.py -r requestfile --level=5 --risk=3 --keep-alive --fresh-queries --random-agent --batch --banner
